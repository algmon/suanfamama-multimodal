# Simple Encoder with Multi-Head Attention for Text
'''
This code demonstrates a basic encoder for text using multi-head attention. It transforms human-readable text into a latent space representation suitable for further processing by a computer.

## Explanation:

Initialization:

vocab_size: Number of unique words in the vocabulary.
embedding_dim: Dimension of the word embeddings.
num_heads: Number of attention heads in the multi-head attention layer.
hidden_dim: Dimension of the hidden layer in the feedforward network.

Embedding:

nn.Embedding: Converts input token IDs into dense vector representations.
Multi-Head Attention:

nn.MultiheadAttention: Performs multi-head attention on the embedded tokens. This allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.
Feedforward Network:

nn.Sequential: A two-layer feedforward network that further processes the attention output.
Layer Normalization:

nn.LayerNorm: Normalizes the output of each layer to improve training stability.
Forward Pass:

The input token IDs are embedded, passed through the multi-head attention layer, the feedforward network, and finally layer normalization.
This simple encoder provides a basic understanding of how multi-head attention can be used to encode text for further processing. More advanced models may include additional layers and techniques for improved performance.

# Simple Example of Text Encoder Usage
'''
Explanation:

Import Libraries: Import the necessary libraries, including torch for tensor operations.
Example Text: Define the text you want to encode.
Tokenization: Use a tokenizer to convert the text into a sequence of token IDs.
Encoder Instance: Create an instance of the TextEncoder class with appropriate parameters.
Encoding: Pass the token IDs as a tensor to the encoder to obtain the encoded representation.
Print Output: Print the encoded text representation.
Note: This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, you would likely need to handle tasks like padding and masking for variable-length sequences. Additionally, the choice of tokenizer and hyperparameters would depend on your specific use case.

# Example input text
text = "Design a dress for me for the party."

# Tokenize the text
tokenizer = ...  # Replace with your preferred tokenizer

token_ids = tokenizer.encode(text)

# Create an instance of the TextEncoder
encoder = TextEncoder(vocab_size=len(tokenizer.vocab), embedding_dim=128, num_heads=4, hidden_dim=256)

# Encode the text
encoded_text = encoder(torch.tensor([token_ids]))

# Print the encoded text
print(encoded_text)
