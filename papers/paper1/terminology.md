## silhouette effect
The silhouette effect is a method used in various fields, such as psychology, design, marketing, and analytics, to measure or represent the distinctiveness, separation, or impact of different entities or groups. The concept varies depending on the context, but it generally relates to how well-defined or separated something is from others in its environment or dataset.

## advertising memory
Advertising memory refers to the ability of consumers to recall or recognize advertisements and the messages they convey after being exposed to them. It encompasses various forms of memory, including:

* Recall: The ability of consumers to retrieve information about an advertisement from memory without external cues. This can be either unaided (e.g., "What ads do you remember seeing during the Super Bowl?") or aided (e.g., "Do you remember the Coca-Cola ad during the Super Bowl?").

* Recognition: The ability to identify an advertisement or brand when presented with it again. This often involves recognizing specific elements of the ad, such as the logo, tagline, or visual imagery.

* Retention: The long-term storage and ability to remember an advertisement over time. This involves not just immediate recall but the persistence of the ad's message in memory, influencing future attitudes and behaviors.

* Persuasive Impact: The extent to which the remembered elements of an advertisement influence consumer attitudes, preferences, and purchase decisions.
