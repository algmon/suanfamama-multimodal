% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.

% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break

% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Static model pruning is presented as a performance optimization technique for large language and vision models. The approach aims to identify and remove neurons, connections unlikely to lead to expected generation results for typical user queries. The goal is to obtain a much smaller model that can quickly return results almost as good as those of the unpruned ones. Through careful analysis of pre-trained weights, bias, activations and user queries, an initial mathematical model based on certain probabilities obtained from the environment is developed to improve on previous results for pruned model size, achieving significant improvement in most cases. This paper explores and compares to previously proposed approaches that perform pruning based on other factors.

\section{Submission of conference papers to ICLR 2025}

ICLR requires electronic submissions, processed by
\url{https://openreview.net/}. See ICLR's website for more instructions.

If your paper is ultimately accepted, the statement {\tt
  {\textbackslash}iclrfinalcopy} should be inserted to adjust the
format to the camera ready requirements.

The format for the submissions is a variant of the NeurIPS format.
Please read carefully the instructions below, and follow them
faithfully.

\subsection{Style}

Papers to be submitted to ICLR 2025 must be prepared according to the
instructions presented here.

%% Please note that we have introduced automatic line number generation
%% into the style file for \LaTeXe. This is to help reviewers
%% refer to specific lines of the paper when they make their comments. Please do
%% NOT refer to these line numbers in your paper as they will be removed from the
%% style file for the final version of accepted papers.

Authors are required to use the ICLR \LaTeX{} style files obtainable at the
ICLR website. Please make sure you use the current files and
not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for rejection.

\subsection{Retrieval of style files}

The style files for ICLR and other conference information are available online at:
\begin{center}
   \url{http://www.iclr.cc/}
\end{center}
The file \verb+iclr2025_conference.pdf+ contains these
instructions and illustrates the
various formatting requirements your ICLR paper must satisfy.
Submissions must be made using \LaTeX{} and the style files
\verb+iclr2025_conference.sty+ and \verb+iclr2025_conference.bst+ (to be used with \LaTeX{}2e). The file
\verb+iclr2025_conference.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing your paper. All you
have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of the paper with
your own.

The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in
sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and \ref{others} below.

\section{General formatting instructions}
\label{gen_inst}

The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).
Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing of 11~points. Times New Roman is the
preferred typeface throughout. Paragraphs are separated by 1/2~line space,
with no indentation.

Paper title is 17~point, in small caps and left-aligned.
All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of the page.

Authors' names are
set in boldface, and each name is placed above its corresponding
address. The lead author's name is to be listed first, and
the co-authors' names are set to follow. Authors sharing the
same address can be on the same line.

Please pay special attention to the instructions in section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.


There will be a strict upper limit of 10 pages for the main text of the initial submission, with unlimited additional pages for citations. 

\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}

First level headings are in small caps,
flush left and in point size 12. One line space before the first level
heading and 1/2~line space after the first level heading.

\subsection{Headings: second level}

Second level headings are in small caps,
flush left and in point size 10. One line space before the second level
heading and 1/2~line space after the second level heading.

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third level headings are in small caps,
flush left and in point size 10. One line space before the third level
heading and 1/2~line space after the third level heading.

\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone, regardless of the formatter being used.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

Citations within the text should be based on the \texttt{natbib} package
and include the authors' last names and year (with the ``et~al.'' construct
for more than two authors). When the authors or the publication are
included in the sentence, the citation should not be in parenthesis using \verb|\citet{}| (as
in ``See \citet{Hinton06} for more information.''). Otherwise, the citation
should be in parenthesis using \verb|\citep{}| (as in ``Deep learning shows promise to make progress
towards AI~\citep{Bengio+chapter2007}.'').

The corresponding references are to be listed in alphabetical order of
authors, in the \textsc{References} section. As to the format of the
references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is used
consistently.

\subsection{Footnotes}

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote} in the
text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches
(12~picas).\footnote{Sample of the second footnote}

\subsection{Figures}

You may use color figures.
However, it is best for the
figure captions and the paper body to make sense if the paper is printed
either in black/white or in color.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
%\framebox[4.0in]{$\;$}
\fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
\end{center}

\fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
\end{center}
\caption{Sample figure caption c.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the table
title, and one line space after the table.

\section{Final instructions}
Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.
In particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text
should fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
\textsc{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
numbered.

\section{Preparing PostScript or PDF files}

Please prepare PostScript or PDF files with paper size ``US Letter'', and
not, for example, ``A4''. The -t
letter option on dvips will produce US Letter files.

Consider directly generating PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+
(especially if you are a MiKTeX user).
PDF figures must be substituted for EPS figures, however.

Otherwise, please generate your PostScript and PDF files with the following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
dvips mypaper.dvi -t letter -Ppdf -G0 -o mypaper.ps
ps2pdf mypaper.ps mypaper.pdf
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Margins in LaTeX}

Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+
from the graphicx package. Always specify the figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below using .eps graphics
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
or % Apr 2009 addition
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
for .pdf graphics.
See section~4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation (\url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.ps})

A number of width problems arise when LaTeX cannot properly hyphenate a
line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command.

\subsubsection*{Author Contributions}
If you'd like to, you may include  a section for author contributions as is done
in many journals. This is optional and at the discretion of the authors.

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}
Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All
acknowledgments, including those to funding agencies, go at the end of the paper.
